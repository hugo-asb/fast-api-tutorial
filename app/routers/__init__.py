'''
There's a subdirectory app/routers/ with another file __init__.py,
so it's a "Python subpackage": app.routers.

The file app/routers/items.py is inside a package, app/routers/, so,
it's a submodule: app.routers.items.

The same with app/routers/users.py, it's another submodule: app.routers.users.
