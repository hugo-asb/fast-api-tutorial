'''
The app directory contains everything. And it has an empty file app/__init__.py,
so it is a "Python package" (a collection of "Python modules"): app.

It contains an app/main.py file. As it is inside a Python package (a directory with
a file __init__.py), it is a "module" of that package: app.main.

There's also an app/dependencies.py file, just like app/main.py, it is a "module": app.dependencies.
